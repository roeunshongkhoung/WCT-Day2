The <html> tag represents the root of an HTML document.
The <html> tag is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the <!DOCTYPE> tag).
Note: You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.
